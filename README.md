Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Matheus

I am Cloud Computing Engineer.

I am a Junior DevOps Engineer with experience in deploying and managing infrastructure using HashiCorp Terraform. Proficient in AWS services such as ECS, EKS, S3, RDS, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Cloud Watch, AWS Orgs and many more. Skilled in using Docker and Linux, with experience in a widely-used open-source implementation. I'm also skilled in Windows Technologies such as AD, DC, DNS and GPOs and other Windows Services.

I currently have two AWS Certifications under my belt, however, I'm studying for more.
